# TrainingReportLaTex
Template for Engineering Training Report according to University of Moratuwa Sri Lanka
This Template based on Industrial Training Book given by Faculty of Engineering University of Moratuwa

! Important: If you are not familiar with LaTex I recommend use classical MS word.

I used some comments on some places that you should change it and also some texts should be changed on your own.
Given report's example has been used "Times New Roman" font but they have mentioned in the document it seems like SF.

I tried this make as close as possible to given recommended style but you can change it your own :-).
